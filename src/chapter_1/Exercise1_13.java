	 * (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the fol-
lowing 2 * 2 system of linear equation:

ax + by = e

cx + dy = f		

     ed - bf
x = ---------
     ad - bc

     af - ec
y = ---------
	 ad - bc


Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y :
3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
2.1x + .55y = 5.9
