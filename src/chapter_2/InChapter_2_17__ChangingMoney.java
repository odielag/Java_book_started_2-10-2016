Suppose you want to develop a program that changes a given amount of money into smaller
monetary units. The program lets the user enter an amount as a double value representing a
total in dollars and cents, and outputs a report listing the monetary equivalent in the maximum
number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, in this order, to result in the mini-
mum number of coins.
