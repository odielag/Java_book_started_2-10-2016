(Science: wind-chill temperature) How cold is it outside? The temperature alone
is not enough to provide the answer. Other factors including wind speed, rela-
tive humidity, and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside.
In 2001, the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill
temperature to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed. The
formula is

t wc = 35.74 + 0.6215t a - 35.75v 0.16 + 0.4275t a v 0.16

where t a is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit and v is the
speed measured in miles per hour. t wc is the wind-chill temperature. The formula
cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58 oF or
above 41oF.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58 oF and
41oF and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 and displays the wind-chill tem-
perature. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute v 0.16 . Here is a sample run:

Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit between -58°F and 41°F:
5.3
Enter the wind speed (>=2) in miles per hour: 6
The wind chill index is -5.56707
