Suppose you want to develop a program to play lottery. The program randomly generates a
lottery of a two-digit number, prompts the user to enter a two-digit number, and determines
whether the user wins according to the following rules:
1. If the user input matches the lottery number in the exact order, the award is $10,000.
2. If all digits in the user input match all digits in the lottery number, the award is $3,000.
3. If one digit in the user input matches a digit in the lottery number, the award is $1,000.
Note that the digits of a two-digit number may be 0 . If a number is less than 10 , we assume
the number is preceded by a 0 to form a two-digit number. For example, number 8 is treated
as 08 and number 0 is treated as 00 in the program. Listing 3.8 gives the complete program.
